	<h1 style="color:peachpuff;text-align:center;font-size: 1.8em;">FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FROM THE FARM TO YOUR KITCHEN IN A DAY!</h1>

	<p style="color:whitesmoke;font-size: 1.5em;">Imagine the present scenario in our society. Our local grocery stores and retail vendors are stocking food that has been tortured overtime during the long hours of transit. We literally have no choice other than to rely on them, unless you have a dedicated farm at your home. At Farm 2 kitchen, we were inspired by the fact that there is a significant quantity of local produce in and around our community. While there is a lot of online food delivering platforms, a platform that enables fresh food to all hands is still about to roll out.

 

	Shouldn’t there be a purpose-built platform aimed to connect local farmers with wholesalers and consumers directly? When our research and surveys revealed that there are significant fruits and vegetables harvested by local farmers, we started to sense the big opportunity. By launching Farm 2 Kitchen, our aim is to thread the lost good food culture of our community. Through our platform, local wholesalers and consumers can find handpicked fresh fruits and vegetables 24×7 online.</p>
